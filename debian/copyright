 Emulate a virtual board which works by passing Linux all the information
 it needs about what devices are present via the device tree.
 There are some restrictions about what we can do here:
 + we can only present devices whose Linux drivers will work based
 purely on the device tree with no platform data at all
 + we want to present a very stripped-down minimalist platform,
 both because this reduces the security attack surface from the guest
 and also because it reduces our exposure to being broken when
 the kernel updates its device tree bindings and requires further
 information in a device binding that we aren't providing.
 This is essentially the same approach kvmtool uses.

 This code implements a TCG which does not generate machine code for some
 real target machine but which generates virtual machine code for an
 interpreter. Interpreted pseudo code is slow, but it works on any host.
 .
 Some remarks might help in understanding the code:
 .
 "target" or "TCG target" is the machine which runs the generated code.
 This is different to the usual meaning in QEMU where "target" is the
 emulated machine. So normally QEMU host is identical to TCG target.
 Here the TCG target is a virtual machine, but this virtual machine must
 use the same word size like the real machine.
 Therefore, we need both 32 and 64 bit virtual machines (interpreter).

 NOTE about MSI-X:
 MSI-X support has been removed for the moment because it leads Windows OS

 BAR created from MSI-X purposes. Windows driver fails to deal with 2 BARs.

 Here postcopy migration of dirty bitmaps is realized. Only QMP-addressable
 bitmaps are migrated.

 Bitmap migration implies creating bitmap with the same name and granularity
 in destination QEMU. If the bitmap with the same name (for the same node)
 already exists on destination an error will be generated.

 Coccinelle only does limited parsing of headers, and chokes on some idioms
 defined in compiler.h and queue.h.  Macros that Coccinelle must know about
 in order to parse .c files must be in a separate macro file---which is
 exactly what you're staring at now.
 .
 To use this file, add the "--macro-file scripts/cocci-macro-file.h" to the
 Coccinelle command line.

 This test is used to check that the serial output of the firmware
 (that we provide for some machines) or some small mini-kernels that
 we provide here contains an expected string. Thus we check that the
 firmware/kernel still boots at least to a certain point and so we
 know that the machine is not completely broken.

 This is a model of the TrustZone memory protection controller (MPC).
 It is documented in the ARM CoreLink SIE-200 System IP for Embedded TRM
 (DDI 0571G):
 https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/m-profile/docs/ddi0571/g
 .
 The MPC sits in front of memory and allows secure software to
 configure it to either pass through or reject transactions.
 Rejected transactions may be configured to either be aborted, or to
 behave as RAZ/WI. An interrupt can be signalled for a rejected transaction.
 .
 The MPC has a register interface which the guest uses to configure it.
 .
 QEMU interface:
 + sysbus MMIO region 0: MemoryRegion for the MPC's config registers
 + sysbus MMIO region 1: MemoryRegion for the upstream end of the MPC
 + Property "downstream": MemoryRegion defining the downstream memory
 + Named GPIO output "irq": set for a transaction-failed interrupt

 This test is used to check that some Open Firmware based machines (i.e.
 OpenBIOS or SLOF) can be started successfully in TCG mode. To do this, we
 first put some Forth code into the "boot-command" Open Firmware environment
 variable. This Forth code writes a well-known magic value to a known location
 in memory. Then we start the guest so that the firmware can boot and finally
 run the Forth code.
 The testing code here then can finally check whether the value has been
 successfully written into the guest memory.

 Test instructions where the semantics write to the destination
 before all the operand reads have been completed.
 .
 These instructions are problematic when we short-circuit the
 register writes because the destination and source operands could
 be the same TCGv.
 .
 We test by forcing the read and write to be register r7.

 QSP profiles the time spent in synchronization primitives, which can
 help diagnose performance problems, e.g. scalability issues when
 contention is high.

 The primitives currently supported are mutexes, recursive mutexes and
 condition variables. Note that not all related functions are intercepted;
 instead we profile only those functions that can have a performance impact,

 This is a model of the "APB timer" which is part of the Cortex-M
 System Design Kit (CMSDK) and documented in the Cortex-M System
 Design Kit Technical Reference Manual (ARM DDI0479C):
 https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/system-design-kits/cortex-m-system-design-kit
 .
 The hardware has an EXTIN input wire, which can be configured
 by the guest to act either as a 'timer enable' (timer does not run
 when EXTIN is low), or as a 'timer clock' (timer runs at frequency
 of EXTIN clock, not PCLK frequency). We don't model this.
 .
 The documentation is not very clear about the exact behaviour;
 we choose to implement that the interrupt is triggered when
 the counter goes from 1 to 0, that the counter then holds at 0
 for one clock cycle before reloading from the RELOAD register,
 and that if the RELOAD register is 0 this does not cause an
 interrupt (as there is no further 1->0 transition).

 This is a model of the TrustZone peripheral protection controller (PPC).
 It is documented in the ARM CoreLink SIE-200 System IP for Embedded TRM
 (DDI 0571G):
 https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/m-profile/docs/ddi0571/g
 .
 The PPC sits in front of peripherals and allows secure software to
 configure it to either pass through or reject transactions.
 Rejected transactions may be configured to either be aborted, or to
 behave as RAZ/WI. An interrupt can be signalled for a rejected transaction.
 .
 The PPC has no register interface -- it is configured purely by a
 collection of input signals from other hardware in the system. Typically
 they are either hardwired or exposed in an ad-hoc register interface by
 the SoC that uses the PPC.
 .
 This QEMU model can be used to model either the AHB5 or APB4 TZ PPC,
 since the only difference between them is that the AHB version has a
 "default" port which has no security checks applied. In QEMU the default
 port can be emulated simply by wiring its downstream devices directly
 into the parent address space, since the PPC does not need to intercept
 transactions there.
 .
 In the hardware, selection of which downstream port to use is done by
 the user's decode logic asserting one of the hsel[] signals. In QEMU,
 we provide 16 MMIO regions, one per port, and the user maps these into
 the desired addresses to implement the address decode.
 .
 QEMU interface:
 + sysbus MMIO regions 0..15: MemoryRegions defining the upstream end
 of each of the 16 ports of the PPC. When a port is unused (i.e. no
 downstream MemoryRegion is connected to it) at the end of the 0..15
 range then no sysbus MMIO region is created for its upstream. When an
 unused port lies in the middle of the range with other used ports at
 higher port numbers, a dummy MMIO region is created to ensure that
 port N's upstream is always sysbus MMIO region N. Dummy regions should
 not be mapped, and will assert if any access is made to them.
 + Property "port[0..15]": MemoryRegion defining the downstream device(s)
 for each of the 16 ports of the PPC
 .

 QEMU interface:
 + Clock input "WDOGCLK": clock for the watchdog's timer
 + sysbus MMIO region 0: the register bank
 + sysbus IRQ 0: watchdog interrupt
 .
 In real hardware the watchdog's reset output is just a GPIO line
 which can then be masked by the board or treated as a simple interrupt.
 (For instance the IoTKit does this with the non-secure watchdog, so that
 secure code can control whether non-secure code can perform a system
 reset via its watchdog.) In QEMU, we just wire up the watchdog reset

 The MPS2 and MPS2+ dev boards are FPGA based (the 2+ has a bigger
 FPGA but is otherwise the same as the 2). Since the CPU itself
 and most of the devices are in the FPGA, the details of the board
 as seen by the guest depend significantly on the FPGA image.
 This source file covers the following FPGA images, for TrustZone cores:
 "mps2-an505" -- Cortex-M33 as documented in ARM Application Note AN505
 "mps2-an521" -- Dual Cortex-M33 as documented in Application Note AN521
 "mps2-an524" -- Dual Cortex-M33 as documented in Application Note AN524
 "mps2-an547" -- Single Cortex-M55 as documented in Application Note AN547
 .
 Links to the TRM for the board itself and to the various Application
 Notes which document the FPGA images can be found here:
 https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/mps2
 .
 Board TRM:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100112/latest/
 Application Note AN505:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0505/latest/
 Application Note AN521:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0521/latest/
 Application Note AN524:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0524/latest/
 Application Note AN547:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0547/latest/
 .
 The AN505 defers to the Cortex-M33 processor ARMv8M IoT Kit FVP User Guide
 (ARM ECM0601256) for the details of some of the device layout:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ecm0601256/latest
 Similarly, the AN521 and AN524 use the SSE-200, and the SSE-200 TRM defines
 most of the device layout:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101104/latest/
 and the AN547 uses the SSE-300, whose layout is in the SSE-300 TRM:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101773/latest/

 This is a model of the TrustZone master security controller (MSC).
 It is documented in the ARM CoreLink SIE-200 System IP for Embedded TRM
 (DDI 0571G):
 https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/m-profile/docs/ddi0571/g
 .
 The MSC sits in front of a device which can be a bus master (such as
 a DMA controller) and allows secure software to configure it to either
 pass through or reject transactions made by that bus master.
 Rejected transactions may be configured to either be aborted, or to
 behave as RAZ/WI. An interrupt can be signalled for a rejected transaction.
 .
 The MSC has no register interface -- it is configured purely by a
 collection of input signals from other hardware in the system. Typically
 they are either hardwired or exposed in an ad-hoc register interface by
 the SoC that uses the MSC.

 Much like the generic-loader this is treated as a special device
 inside QEMU. However unlike the generic-loader this device is used
 to load guest images for hypervisors. As part of that process the
 hypervisor needs to have platform information passed to it by the
 lower levels of the stack (e.g. firmware/bootloader). If you boot
 the hypervisor directly you use the guest-loader to load the Dom0
 or equivalent guest images in the right place in the same way a
 boot loader would.
 .
 This is only relevant for full system emulation.

 Internally inside QEMU this is a device. It is a strange device that
 provides no hardware interface but allows QEMU to monkey patch memory
 specified when it is created. To be able to do this it has a reset
 callback that does the memory operations.

 How to add or update the tests or commit changes that affect ACPI tables:
 Contributor:
 1. add empty files for new tables, if any, under tests/data/acpi
 2. list any changed files in tests/qtest/bios-tables-test-allowed-diff.h
 3. commit the above *before* making changes that affect the tables
 .
 Contributor or ACPI Maintainer (steps 4-7 need to be redone to resolve conflicts
 in binary commit created in step 6):
 .
 After 1-3 above tests will pass but ignore differences with the expected files.
 You will also notice that tests/qtest/bios-tables-test-allowed-diff.h lists
 a bunch of files. This is your hint that you need to do the below:

 The VM generation ID (``vmgenid``) device is an emulated device which
 exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically random, integer value identifier,
 referred to as a Globally Unique Identifier, or GUID.
 .
 This allows management applications (e.g. libvirt) to notify the guest
 operating system when the virtual machine is executed with a different
 configuration (e.g. snapshot execution or creation from a template).  The
 guest operating system notices the change, and is then able to react as
 appropriate by marking its copies of distributed databases as dirty,
 re-initializing its random number generator etc.

 The hardware exposes two register sets, a legacy set and a 'new' set. The
 model implements the 'new' register set, and logs warnings on accesses to
 the legacy IO space.
 .
 The hardware uses 32bit registers to manage 51 IRQs, with low and high
 registers for each conceptual register. The device model's implementation
 uses 64bit data types to store both low and high register values (in the one
 member), but must cope with access offset values in multiples of 4 passed to
 the callbacks. As such the read() and write() implementations process the
 provided offset to understand whether the access is requesting the lower or
 upper 32 bits of the 64bit member.
 .
 Additionally, the "Interrupt Enable", "Edge Status" and "Software Interrupt"
 fields have separate "enable"/"status" and "clear" registers, where set bits
 are written to one or the other to change state (avoiding a
 read-modify-write sequence).

 Note: --max-width 80 is needed because coccinelle default is less
 than 80, and without this parameter coccinelle may reindent some
 lines which fit into 80 characters but not to coccinelle default,
 which in turn produces extra patch hunks for no reason.

 In the v8M architecture, the IDAU is a small piece of hardware
 typically implemented in the SoC which provides board or SoC
 specific security attribution information for each address that
 the CPU performs MPU/SAU checks on. For QEMU, we model this with a
 QOM interface which is implemented by the board or SoC object and
 connected to the CPU using a link property.

 Saving and restoring the state of virtio devices is a bit of a twisty maze,
 for several reasons:
 - state is distributed between several parts:
 - virtio core, for common fields like features, number of queues, ...
 - virtio transport (pci, ccw, ...), for the different proxy devices and
 transport specific state (msix vectors, indicators, ...)
 - virtio device (net, blk, ...), for the different device types and their
 state (mac address, request queue, ...)
 - most fields are saved via the stream interface; subsequently, subsections
 have been added to make cross-version migration possible
 .
 This file attempts to document the current procedure and point out some
 caveats.

 The MPS2 and MPS2+ dev boards are FPGA based (the 2+ has a bigger
 FPGA but is otherwise the same as the 2). Since the CPU itself
 and most of the devices are in the FPGA, the details of the board
 as seen by the guest depend significantly on the FPGA image.
 We model the following FPGA images:
 "mps2-an385" -- Cortex-M3 as documented in ARM Application Note AN385
 "mps2-an386" -- Cortex-M4 as documented in ARM Application Note AN386
 "mps2-an500" -- Cortex-M7 as documented in ARM Application Note AN500
 "mps2-an511" -- Cortex-M3 'DesignStart' as documented in AN511
 .
 Links to the TRM for the board itself and to the various Application
 Notes which document the FPGA images can be found here:

 This is a model of the "System counter" which is documented in
 the Arm SSE-123 Example Subsystem Technical Reference Manual:
 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101370/latest/
 .
 The system counter is a non-stop 64-bit up-counter. It provides
 this count value to other devices like the SSE system timer,
 which are driven by this system timestamp rather than directly
 from a clock. Internally to the counter the count is actually
 88-bit precision (64.24 fixed point), with a programmable scale factor.

 The hardware has the optional feature that it supports dynamic
 clock switching, where two clock inputs are connected, and which
 one is used is selected via a CLKSEL input signal. Since the
 users of this device in QEMU don't use this feature, we only model

 Assumptions:
 - NULL cannot be inserted/removed as a pointer value.
 - Trying to insert an already-existing hash-pointer pair is OK. However,
 it is not OK to insert into the same hash table different hash-pointer
 pairs that have the same pointer value, but not the hashes.
 - Lookups are performed under an RCU read-critical section; removals
 must wait for a grace period to elapse before freeing removed objects.
 .
 Features:
 - Reads (i.e. lookups and iterators) can be concurrent with other reads.
 Lookups that are concurrent with writes to the same bucket will retry
 via a seqlock; iterators acquire all bucket locks and therefore can be
 concurrent with lookups and are serialized wrt writers.
 - Writes (i.e. insertions/removals) can be concurrent with writes to
 different buckets; writes to the same bucket are serialized through a lock.
 - Optional auto-resizing: the hash table resizes up if the load surpasses
 a certain threshold. Resizing is done concurrently with readers; writes
 are serialized with the resize operation.
 .
 The key structure is the bucket, which is cacheline-sized. Buckets
 contain a few hash values and pointers; the u32 hash values are stored in
 full so that resizing is fast. Having this structure instead of directly
 chaining items has two advantages:
 - Failed lookups fail fast, and touch a minimum number of cache lines.
 - Resizing the hash table with concurrent lookups is easy.
 .
 There are two types of buckets:

 For most instructions that use the same element size for reads and
 writes, we can use real gvec vector expansion, which potantially uses
 real host vector instructions. As they only work up to 64 bit elements,
 128 bit elements (vector is a single element) have to be handled
 differently. Operations that are too complicated to encode via TCG ops
 are handled via gvec ool (out-of-line) handlers.
 .
 As soon as instructions use different element sizes for reads and writes
 or access elements "out of their element scope" we expand them manually
 in fancy loops, as gvec expansion does not deal with actual element
 numbers and does also not support access to other elements.
 .
 128 bit elements:
 As we only have i32/i64, such elements have to be loaded into two

 a memory protection controller
 a security controller
 a bus fabric which arranges that some parts of the address
 space are secure and non-secure aliases of each other
 The SSE-200 additionally contains:
 a second Cortex-M33
 two Message Handling Units (MHUs)
 an optional CryptoCell (which we do not model)
 more SRAM banks with associated MPCs
 multiple Power Policy Units (PPUs)
 a control interface for an icache for each CPU
 per-CPU identity and control register blocks
 .
 QEMU interface:
 + Clock input "MAINCLK": clock for CPUs and most peripherals
 + Clock input "S32KCLK": slow 32KHz clock used for a few peripherals
 + QOM property "memory" is a MemoryRegion containing the devices provided
 by the board model.

 This specification contains minimal information about Parallels Disk Format,
 which is enough to proper work with QEMU. Nevertheless, Parallels Cloud Server
 and Parallels Desktop are able to add some unspecified nodes to xml and use
 them, but they are for internal work and don't affect functionality. Also it
 uses auxiliary xml "Snapshot.xml", which allows to store optional snapshot
 information, but it doesn't influence open/read/write functionality. QEMU and
 other software should not use fields not covered in this document and
 Snapshot.xml file and must leave them as is.

 Test that UNDEFINED 32-bit instructions fault as expected.  This is an
 interesting test because ARMv6-M shares code with its more fully-featured
 siblings and it's necessary to verify that its limited instruction set is
 emulated correctly.
 .
 The emulator must be invoked with -semihosting so that the test case can
 terminate with exit code 0 on success or 1 on failure.

 L2 table cache usage is as follows:
 .
 An open image has one L2 table cache that is used to avoid accessing the
 image file for recently referenced L2 tables.
 .
 Cluster offset lookup translates the logical offset within the block device
 to a cluster offset within the image file.  This is done by indexing into
 the L1 and L2 tables which store cluster offsets.  It is here where the L2
 table cache serves up recently referenced L2 tables.
 .
 If there is a cache miss, that L2 table is read from the image file and
 committed to the cache.  Subsequent accesses to that L2 table will be served
 from the cache until the table is evicted from the cache.
 .
 L2 tables are also committed to the cache when new L2 tables are allocated
 in the image file.  Since the L2 table cache is write-through, the new L2
 table is first written out to the image file and then committed to the
 cache.
 .
 Multiple I/O requests may be using an L2 table cache entry at any given
 time.  That means an entry may be in use across several requests and
 reference counting is needed to free the entry at the correct time.  In
 particular, an entry evicted from the cache will only be freed once all
 references are dropped.
 .
 An in-flight I/O request will hold a reference to a L2 table cache entry for
 the period during which it needs to access the L2 table.  This includes
 cluster offset lookup, L2 table allocation, and L2 table update when a new
 data cluster has been allocated.
 .
 An interesting case occurs when two requests need to access an L2 table that
 is not in the cache.  Since the operation to read the table from the image
 file takes some time to complete, both requests may see a cache miss and
 start reading the L2 table from the image file.  The first to finish will
 commit its L2 table into the cache.  When the second tries to commit its
 table will be deleted in favor of the existing cache entry.

 The theory here is that it should be possible to create a machine without
 knowledge of specific devices.  Historically board init routines have
 passed a bunch of arguments to each device, requiring the board know
 exactly which device it is dealing with.  This file provides an abstract
 API for device configuration and initialization.  Devices will generally
 inherit from a particular bus (e.g. PCI or I2C) rather than
 this API directly.

 Encodings for the unconditional VFP instructions are here:
 generally anything matching A32
 1111 1110 .... .... .... 101. ...0 ....
 and T32
 1111 110. .... .... .... 101. .... ....
 1111 1110 .... .... .... 101. .... ....
 (but those patterns might also cover some Neon instructions,
 which do not live in this file.)
 .
 VFP registers have an odd encoding with a four-bit field
 and a one-bit field which are assembled in different orders
 depending on whether the register is double or single precision.
 Each individual instruction function must do the checks for
 "double register selected but CPU does not have double support"
 and "double register number has bit 4 set but CPU does not
 support D16-D31" (which should UNDEF).

 Encodings for the conditional VFP instructions are here:
 generally anything matching A32
 cccc 11.. .... .... .... 101. .... ....
 and T32
 1110 110. .... .... .... 101. .... ....
 1110 1110 .... .... .... 101. .... ....
 (but those patterns might also cover some Neon instructions,
 which do not live in this file.)
 .
 VFP registers have an odd encoding with a four-bit field
 and a one-bit field which are assembled in different orders
 depending on whether the register is double or single precision.
 Each individual instruction function must do the checks for
 "double register selected but CPU does not have double support"
 and "double register number has bit 4 set but CPU does not
 support D16-D31" (which should UNDEF).

 It is forbidden to access Thread Local Storage in coroutines because
 compiler optimizations may cause values to be cached across coroutine
 re-entry. Coroutines can run in more than one thread through the course of
 their life, leading bugs when stale TLS values from the wrong thread are
 used as a result of compiler optimization.
 .
 An example is:
 .
 ..code-block:: c
 :caption: A coroutine that may see the wrong TLS value

Copyright: 1989-1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 .
 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
 Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
 Public License instead of this License.

 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts

 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 .
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 .
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)
 .
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.
 .
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.
 .
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 .
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

 This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Copyright: 1989-1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 .
 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
 Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.

 There are limited CI compute resources available to QEMU, so the
 cost/benefit tradeoff of adding new OS distros needs to be considered.
 .
 * File an issue at https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-ci/-/issues
 pointing to the qemu-devel mail thread in the archives.
 .
 This alerts other people who might be interested in the work
 to avoid duplication, as well as to get feedback from libvirt-ci
 maintainers on any tips to ease the addition
 .
 Assuming there is agreement to add a new OS distro then
 .
 * Fork the ``libvirt-ci`` project on gitlab
 .
 * Add metadata under ``lcitool/facts/targets/`` for the new OS
 distro. There might be code changes required if the OS distro
 uses a package format not currently known. The ``libvirt-ci``
 maintainers can advise on this when the issue is filed.
 .
 * Edit the ``lcitool/facts/mappings.yml`` change to add entries for
 the new OS, listing the native package names for as many packages
 as practical.  Run ``python -m pytest --regenerate-output`` and
 check that the changes are correct.
 .
 * Commit the changes to ``lcitool/facts`` and the regenerated test
 files, and submit a merge request to the ``libvirt-ci`` project.
 Please note in the description that this is a new build pre-requisite
 desired for use with QEMU
 .
 * CI pipeline will run to validate that the changes to ``mappings.yml``
 are correct, by attempting to install the newly listed package on
 all OS distributions supported by ``libvirt-ci``.
 .
 * Once the merge request is accepted, go back to QEMU and update
 the ``libvirt-ci`` submodule to point to a commit that contains
 the ``mappings.yml`` update.

 Tests
 ~~~~~
 .
 Different tests are added to cover various configurations to build and test
 QEMU.  Docker tests are the executables under ``tests/docker`` named
 ``test-*``. They are typically shell scripts and are built on top of a shell
 library, ``tests/docker/common.rc``, which provides helpers to find the QEMU
 source and build it.
 .
 The full list of tests is printed in the ``make docker-help`` help.

 The script has two modes of execution:
 .
 1) if invoked with a path on the command line (possibly
 preceded by a "--" argument), it will run the analysis on
 an existing build directory
 .
 2) otherwise, it will configure and builds QEMU itself in a
 "+build" subdirectory which is left around when the script
 exits.  In this case the command line is passed directly to
 "make" (typically used for a "-j" argument suitable for your
 system).

 Q: Patchwork web based patch tracking system site
 T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit.
 S: Status, one of the following (keep in sync with docs/devel/maintainers.rst):
 Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
 Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
 Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
 much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
 Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
 role as you write your new code].
 Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
 it has been replaced by a better system and you
 should be using that.
 F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
 A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
 F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
 F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
 F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
 One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
 X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
 Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
 Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
 F:	net/
 X:	net/ipv6/
 matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
 K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
 patch or file.  For instance:

 We support instrumentation at an instruction granularity. That is,
 if a plugin wants to instrument the memory accesses performed by a
 particular instruction, it can just do that instead of instrumenting
 all memory accesses. Thus, in order to do this we first have to
 translate a TB, so that plugins can decide what/where to instrument.
 .
 Injecting the desired instrumentation could be done with a second
 translation pass that combined the instrumentation requests, but that
 would be ugly and inefficient since we would decode the guest code twice.
 Instead, during TB translation we add "empty" instrumentation calls for all
 possible instrumentation events, and then once we collect the instrumentation
 requests from plugins, we either "fill in" those empty events or remove them
 if they have no requests.
 .
 When "filling in" an event we first copy the empty callback's TCG ops. This
 might seem unnecessary, but it is done to support an arbitrary number
 of callbacks per event. Take for example a regular instruction callback.
 We first generate a callback to an empty helper function. Then, if two
 plugins register one callback each for this instruction, we make two copies
 of the TCG ops generated for the empty callback, substituting the function
 pointer that points to the empty helper function with the plugins' desired
 callback functions. After that we remove the empty callback's ops.
 .
 Note that the location in TCGOp.args[] of the pointer to a helper function
 varies across different guest and host architectures. Instead of duplicating
 the logic that figures this out, we rely on the fact that the empty
 callbacks point to empty functions that are unique pointers in the program.
 Thus, to find the right location we just have to look for a match in
 TCGOp.args[]. This is the main reason why we first copy an empty callback's
 TCG ops and then fill them in; regardless of whether we have one or many
 callbacks for that event, the logic to add all of them is the same.
 .
 When generating more than one callback per event, we make a small
 optimization to avoid generating redundant operations. For instance, for the
 second and all subsequent callbacks of an event, we do not need to reload the
 CPU's index into a TCG temp, since the first callback did it already.

 This peripheral is roughly divided into 3 main parts:
 - the PLLs
 - the PLL channels
 - the clock muxes
 .
 A main oscillator (xosc) feeds all the PLLs. Each PLLs has one or more
 channels. Those channel are then connected to the clock muxes. Each mux has
 multiples sources (usually the xosc, some of the PLL channels and some "test
 debug" clocks). A mux is configured to select a given source through its
 control register. Each mux has one output clock that also goes out of the
 CPRMAN. This output clock usually connects to another peripheral in the SoC
 (so a given mux is dedicated to a peripheral).
 .
 At each level (PLL, channel and mux), the clock can be altered through
 dividers (and multipliers in case of the PLLs), and can be disabled (in this
 case, the next levels see no clock).
 .
 This can be sum-up as follows (this is an example and not the actual BCM2835
 clock tree):
 .
 /-->[PLL]-|->[PLL channel]--...            [mux]--> to peripherals
 |         |->[PLL channel]  muxes takes    [mux]
 |         \->[PLL channel]  inputs from    [mux]
 |                           some channels  [mux]
 [xosc]---|-->[PLL]-|->[PLL channel]  and other srcs [mux]
 |         \->[PLL channel]           ...-->[mux]
 |                                          [mux]

Copyright: 2017-2020 Linaro Limited  Peter Maydell
License:   __UNKNOWN__
 Note that this script will automatically download and
 run the (closed-source) coverity build tools, so don't
 use it if you don't trust them!
 .
 This script assumes that you're running it from a QEMU source
 tree, and that tree is a fresh clean one, because we do an in-tree
 build. (This is necessary so that the filenames that the Coverity
 Scan server sees are relative paths that match up with the component
 regular expressions it uses; an out-of-tree build won't work for this.)
 The host machine should have as many of QEMU's dependencies
 installed as possible, for maximum coverity coverage.
 .
 To do an upload you need to be a maintainer in the Coverity online
 service, and you will need to know the "Coverity token", which is a
 secret 8 digit hex string. You can find that from the web UI in the
 project settings, if you have maintainer access there.
 .
 Command line options:
 --dry-run : run the tools, but don't actually do the upload
 --docker : create and work inside a container
 --docker-engine : specify the container engine to use (docker/podman/auto);
 implies --docker
 --update-tools-only : update the cached copy of the tools, but don't run them
 --no-update-tools : do not update the cached copy of the tools
 --tokenfile : file to read Coverity token from
 --version ver : specify version being analyzed (default: ask git)
 --description desc : specify description of this version (default: ask git)
 --srcdir : QEMU source tree to analyze (default: current working dir)
 --results-tarball : path to copy the results tarball to (default: don't
 copy it anywhere, just upload it)
 --src-tarball : tarball to untar into src dir (default: none); this
 is intended mainly for internal use by the Docker support
 .

 While most semihosting implementations support reading and writing
 to arbitrary file descriptors we treat the console as something
 specifically for debugging interaction. This means messages can be
 re-directed to gdb (if currently being used to debug) or even
 re-directed elsewhere.

 This is an educational device for writing (kernel) drivers. Its original
 intention was to support the Linux kernel lectures taught at the Masaryk
 University. Students are given this virtual device and are expected to write a
 driver with I/Os, IRQs, DMAs and such.
 .
 The devices behaves very similar to the PCI bridge present in the COMBO6 cards
 developed under the Liberouter wings. Both PCI device ID and PCI space is
 inherited from that device.

 This controls the configuration of semihosting for all guest
 targets that support it. Architecture specific handling is handled
 in target/HW/HW-semi.c
 .
 Semihosting is slightly strange in that it is also supported by some
 linux-user targets. However in that use case no configuration of
 the outputs and command lines is supported.
 .
 The config module is common to all system targets however as vl.c
 needs to link against the helpers.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 .
  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 .
   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 .
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)
 .
     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.
 .
     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 .
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 .
   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
                             NO WARRANTY
 .
   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 .
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 That's all there is to it!

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 			    Preamble
 .
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 .
   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 .
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
 			    NO WARRANTY
 .
   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 .
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.

# License file: LICENSE
 The QEMU distribution includes both the QEMU emulator and
 various firmware files.  These are separate programs that are
 distributed together for our users' convenience, and they have
 separate licenses.
 .
 The following points clarify the license of the QEMU emulator:
 .
 1) The QEMU emulator as a whole is released under the GNU General
 Public License, version 2.
 .
 2) Parts of the QEMU emulator have specific licenses which are compatible
 with the GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file
 contains its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing
 information are released under the GNU General Public License, version
 2 or (at your option) any later version.
 .
 As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
 License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
 or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.
 .
 3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is mostly under the BSD or MIT licenses;
    but some parts may be GPLv2 or other licenses. Again, see the
    specific licensing information in each source file.
 .
 4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.
